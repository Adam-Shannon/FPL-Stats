# FPL-Stats-Scripts
 Simple test scripts to get stats on fantasy premier league.
 The intitally available script getDefenders.py is an extensible example of scraping statistics from the official fantasy premier league website which finds the   defenders with the most goals, most assists and most clean sheets (games where the opponent has not scored).

There now exists the outline of a python class which provides a more dynamic and usable way to handle the data scraped and which will be adapted in future to provide more data handling and analysis facilities.
